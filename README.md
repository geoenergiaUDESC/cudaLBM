# cudaLBM

`cudaLBM` is a high-performance computing project that implements the moment representation of the Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) on a single Nvidia GPU using CUDA. This project is currently under development and is primarily focused on Linux-based systems.

## üöÄ Features

* **Lattice Boltzmann Method:** Implements the LBM for fluid dynamics simulations.
* **D3Q19 and D3Q27 Models:** Implements both **D3Q19** and **D3Q27** velocity sets for complex three-dimensional simulations.
* **High-Order Collision Models:** Will implement high-order collision models for improved accuracy.
* **Example Cases:** Includes a lid-driven cavity case to demonstrate the solver's capabilities, with more cases to be added in the future.

## ‚ö° Performance

The code has been benchmarked with the lid driven cavity case using FP32 for both storage and arithmetic. The performance on various NVIDIA GPUs is as follows:

* **NVIDIA RTX A4000:** ~3300 MLUPS
* **NVIDIA RTX 4090:** ~6600 MLUPS
* **NVIDIA RTX 5090:** ~12900 MLUPS

MLUPS stands for Million Lattice Updates Per Second. There is still room for improvement, as further optimizations are planned.

## üìÖ Future Features

* **Multi-GPU Support:** Future versions will leverage CUDA-aware MPI for efficient scaling across multiple GPUs.

## üîß Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
* NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/geoenergiaUDESC/cudaLBM.git](https://github.com/geoenergiaUDESC/cudaLBM.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory and load the bashrc file:
   
    ```bash
    cd cudaLBM
    source bashrc
    ```
    
3.  Compile the project:
    ```bash
    make install
    ```

## üí® Usage

### Running a Simulation

To run a simulation, you must first navigate to the case directory (e.g., the `lidDrivenCavity` folder). You can then execute the compiled binary for the desired model:

```bash
# For the D3Q19 model
momentBasedD3Q19 -GPU 0
```

```bash
# For the D3Q27 model
momentBasedD3Q27 -GPU 0
```

### Required Files

The following files **must** be present in the working (case) directory to run a simulation:

* `programControl`
* `latticeMesh`
* `initialConditions`

Additionally, the optional `functionObjects` file may be present to enable runtime post-processing.

### Runtime Function Objects

The `functionObjects` file allows you to compute various quantities at runtime. Currently, it supports calculating the **kinetic energy** and the **strain rate tensor** of the flow, as well as their time averages.

For example, including the following in your `functionObjects` file:

```plaintext
functionObjectList
{
    S;
    SMean;
    k;
    kMean;
};
```

## üì¶ Post-Processing

The project includes two key executables for post-processing: `fieldConvert` and `fieldCalculate`.

### fieldConvert

`fieldConvert` is primarily used to convert the `.LBMBin` files (saved by the solver) into other file types for visualization (e.g., `.vts` for ParaView).

* **Default Conversion:** By default, it converts the 10 hydrodynamic moment variables.
  
    ```bash
    fieldConvert -fileType vts
    ```
* **Convert Specific Fields:** You can convert other fields, like those generated by `functionObjects`.
  
    ```bash
    fieldConvert -fileType vts -fieldName kMean
    ```
* **Extract Cut Plane:** It can also extract a cut plane in an arbitrary cardinal plane at a specific value.
  
    ```bash
    fieldConvert -fileType vts -fieldName kMean -cutPlane z=0.5
    ```

### fieldCalculate

`fieldCalculate` is used to perform mathematical operations on the solution fields.

* **Check for NaN:** Inspect whether a field contains NaN values.
    ```bash
    fieldCalculate -calculationType containsNaN
    ```
    
* **Calculate Derivatives:**
    ```bash
    # Calculate vorticity
    fieldCalculate -calculationType vorticity
    ```

    ```bash
    # Calculate divergence of velocity
    fieldCalculate -calculationType div[U]
    ```
    
* **Calculate Spatial Mean:**
    ```bash
    # Calculate spatial mean of velocity (default)
    fieldCalculate -calculationType spatialMean
    ```

    ```bash
    # Calculate spatial mean of a specific field
    fieldCalculate -calculationType spatialMean -fieldName kMean
    ```

### ‚è±Ô∏è Latest Time Flag

Both `fieldConvert` and `fieldCalculate` can be limited to run on **only the latest saved time step** by adding the `-latestTime` flag. This is useful for quick visualization or saving disk space.

```bash
fieldConvert -fileType vts -fieldName kMean -latestTime
```

```bash
fieldCalculate -fileType vts -calculationType div[U] -latestTime
```
